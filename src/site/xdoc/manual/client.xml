      <p>Hearsay is built from a custom Apache Karaf distribution.
      This means that all the operations available from a default
      installation of Karaf are available in Hearsay...which
      includes remote access via SSH to a sandboxed console.  The
      default port for the SSH daemon is 8101 and can be changed by
      etc/org.apache.karaf.shell.cfg configuration file.  Replace
      "serverName" with the hostname of your server.</p>
      <pre>$ ssh -p 8101 -l karaf &lt;serverName&gt;</pre>
